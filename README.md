# Bank-Application

## Story

This application is a demo for a company who asked for a bank application backend.
###### The basic requirements were:
  - **Opening accounts(creating new accounts)**
  - **Depositing amount to account** and **Withdraw amount from account**
  - **Transferring amount between accounts** and **requesting the current balance of account**
  - **Traceability** and **historical data**, for instance but it was not really a requirement

## Technical details

The backend was made with **_Java_** and **_Spring Boot_**. **_H2_** Database was used in the application with **_JPA_** design pattern to handle/request data.
Creating frontend **_was not a requirement_** but in the future I would like to deal with creating one with **_React_** but the process is currently **_suspended_**.

but the process is currently suspended
## Starting the application

This is a **_maven_** project, so first thing to do is installing the **_pom.xml_** **dependencies** to run this application.
